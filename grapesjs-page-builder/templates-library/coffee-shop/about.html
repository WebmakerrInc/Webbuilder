      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        Bean Haven was born from a friendship that started over a shared love of rich espresso.
        We source beans directly from farmers, roast in small batches, and celebrate community with every cup.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        From pop-up carts to our flagship cafe, our mission has always been to make specialty coffee approachable and inviting.
